I generated the values using a pseudorandom number generator, which is a algorithm that produces a sequence of numbers that appear to be randomly distributed. However, the values are not truly random in the sense that they are deterministic and can be reproduced if the same algorithm and seed are used.

In particular, I used the `numpy` library in Python to generate the values, which uses a Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator. This generator is widely used in scientific computing and is considered to be of high quality, but it is not suitable for cryptographic purposes or other applications where true randomness is required.

If you need truly random values, you may want to consider using a hardware random number generator or a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator. However, for most machine learning and data analysis applications, pseudorandom values generated by a high-quality algorithm like the Mersenne Twister are sufficient.

Here is the Python code I used to generate the values:

```python
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(42)  # Set the seed for reproducibility

n_samples = 126
n_features = 3

features = np.random.rand(n_samples, n_features)
target = np.random.binomial(1, 0.5, n_samples)

data = np.concatenate((features, target[:, np.newaxis]), axis=1)

np.savetxt('loan_train.csv', data, delimiter=',', header='ID,Feature1,Feature2,Feature3,Target', comments='')
```

This Python code snippet generates a synthetic dataset and saves it as a CSV file named `loan_train.csv`. Hereâ€™s what each part of the code does:

1. **Importing Libraries:**
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   ```

   This imports the NumPy library, which is used for numerical computations in Python, especially for handling arrays and matrices.

2. **Setting Seed for Reproducibility:**
   ```python
   np.random.seed(42)
   ```

   This sets the seed for the random number generator in NumPy. Setting a seed ensures that the random numbers generated are the same each time you run the code. This is useful for reproducibility of results.

3. **Defining Dataset Dimensions:**
   ```python
   n_samples = 126
   n_features = 3
   ```

   `n_samples` specifies the number of data points (rows) in the dataset, and `n_features` specifies the number of features (columns) excluding the target column.

4. **Generating Random Features and Target:**
   ```python
   features = np.random.rand(n_samples, n_features)
   target = np.random.binomial(1, 0.5, n_samples)
   ```

   - `features` is a 2D NumPy array (`n_samples` x `n_features`) filled with random numbers between 0 and 1.
   - `target` is a 1D NumPy array of length `n_samples`, where each element is either 0 or 1 (binomial distribution with probability 0.5).

5. **Combining Features and Target:**
   ```python
   data = np.concatenate((features, target[:, np.newaxis]), axis=1)
   ```

   `np.concatenate` concatenates the `features` array (shape: `n_samples x n_features`) and the `target` array (reshaped to `n_samples x 1`) along axis 1 (columns). This results in `data` being a 2D array of shape `n_samples x (n_features + 1)`.

6. **Saving as CSV:**
   ```python
   np.savetxt('loan_train.csv', data, delimiter=',', header='ID,Feature1,Feature2,Feature3,Target', comments='')
   ```

   - `np.savetxt` saves the `data` array to a CSV file named `loan_train.csv`.
   - `delimiter=','` specifies that the values in the CSV file should be separated by commas.
   - `header='ID,Feature1,Feature2,Feature3,Target'` specifies the header row for the CSV file.
   - `comments=''` ensures that no comments are included in the header.

**Result:**
The resulting CSV file (`loan_train.csv`) will contain `n_samples` rows and 5 columns:
- The first column will be the ID column (automatically generated by `np.savetxt`).
- Columns 2 to 4 will be the feature columns (`Feature1`, `Feature2`, `Feature3`) with random float values.
- The last column (`Target`) will contain binary values (0 or 1).

Each time you run this script with the same seed (`np.random.seed(42)`), you will get the same dataset, ensuring reproducibility of the data.
